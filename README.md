# Image_Colorization using Autoencoder

In this project, the model is trained to color images from grayscale images based on CNN. The Model comprises VGG16(encoder) and a custom-made decoder. LAB color space is used. L channel is fed as input to autoencoder and A, B channels are predicted by the model. L(input) and A, B(output) channels are combined to produce a color image.
